  <p>This website is dedicated to my younger self.<br />
  Growing up without the internet meant the <b><u>worst</u></b> time for my hair.
  I had no clue what to do, and I kept making things worse by using the wrong products.
  Figuring out what you hair needs can be a challenge and I just wanna help you cause I know it sucks.
